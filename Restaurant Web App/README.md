# mis407f22-team-4 Final Project
Our Final project is a Restaurant Order Management system. Intended for the use of servers to be able to place orders
to the kitchen more easily it allows for a server to input a table number and then add food to that table all while keeping
track of the cost of their food.

To Run clone the repository and then run the ROM_WebApp_Final.py to run our program!
